Those Apple Guys Dev/Deployment Guide

Dev:

1. TAG site is built on compass framework.  So always edit style in SASS files, and use "compass watch" command in terminal to track changes and update CSS files
2. Use normal Git committing protocol
3. To push live, fetch latest commit in the projects/those_apple_guys_deploy directory, and the git ftp push to the TAG FTP server

Notes:
What is where?
  When possible, move to SASS partials, to keep the screen.sass file light.  These will be compiled into the screen.css file automatically (by "compass watch") before committing.
  Includes have been used for parts of the site that are shared communaly (like Header, Footer, Meta tags, etc.)
  The goal currently has been to move everything from static assets to dynamically generated CSS3 elements.  The idea is, if the site looks advanced and awesome, the product/service likely is as well!

TODO:

  So many things.
  Get Chip's input so the site is actually good.
  Re-do services page (move to jQuery/AJAX)
