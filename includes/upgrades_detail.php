<h4>Upgrades</h4>

<p>We offer the easiest ways on earth to upgrade.  Give us your computer, and we’ll give it back to you upgraded.  Whether you’re going from Tiger to Leopard – Leopard to Snow Leopard – Snow Leopard to Lion  or even OS8.6 to OS 9.2.  We guarantee that we’ll transfer over all your documents, movies, music and whatever is important to you.  AND we’ll make sure everything opens correctly on your new operating system.  If the program you worked with in the past doesn’t exist or can’t be installed on newer versions of Mac, we’ll find something that works.</p>
